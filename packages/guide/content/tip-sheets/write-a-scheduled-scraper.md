## Write a scraper

Need some JSON kept up to date? You can use our [GitHub Action scraper bluprint](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_github-action-scraper) to create a scraper you can automate.

Our bluprint will help you:

- Write a NodeJS script that can get, parse and clean your data, whether you're hitting an API, scraping a website or downloading a massive datafile.
- Test your scraper locally and publish your data to AWS, just by pushing your code to our team GitHub.
- Schedule your scraper to run on a schedule, whether you need it every 5 minutes or once a week.

Check out the [repo](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_github-action-scraper) in GitHub for more instructions, then add the bluprint to your CLI to use the code:

```
$ bluprint add reuters-graphics/bluprint_github-action-scraper
```
