[Earnings reference spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zzWvfTVp-JvjOlrfRRoSVSHDa1KvrFHfVNaf3xhYtU/edit?usp=sharing)  outlines:
- Assignments
- Day and time (before/after mkt close) company reports
- Link to where graphic is published in the server
- Company's investor relations page
- Interactive graphic link
- Link to spreadsheets containing updatable data

### How to update
1. Determine what figures you need to update
    * Look at the already published graphic to find the figures you need to update. So for example, if the charts in the final graphic show EPS, revenue and net income, that's what you need to search for in the investor relations financial statement. These commonly include:
        * EPS (earnings per share)
        * ROE (return on investment)
        * revenue
        * net income
        * sales/users/deliveries
     
2. Find the updated figures
    * Visit company's investor relations page and find the financial statement for the quarter you want to update. You can find this by either visiting the link in the `INVESTOR RELATIONS` column in the spreadsheet or googling something like "Tesla investor relations".
    * Once you find the financial statement (normally a link to a pdf), search for the figures you need to update. (Control F)

3. Update the graphic with the latest figures
    * Open the graphic's linked spreadsheet. You can find the correct spreadsheet in column `SHEET-1`. If there are two sheets feeding the graphic, the second will be in `SHEET 2`.
    * Add a new row for the current quarter
    * Add the latest figures
    
4. Make flat
    * Check that the numbers updated properly in the interactive graphic
    * Once the graphic has updated, copy the url into safari and add `?media=true` to convert to flat-friendly format.
    * Right click > print page > save as pdf
    * Place pdf in illustrator and make needed adjustments
    * Export as jpeg and eps, save to appropriate folders:
        * EPS folder (jpg + eps)
        * IMG folder (jpg)
    * zip folder and upload to server (specific link to the graphic in the server can be found in column `SERVER-URL` in the spreadsheet)
    * republish - Choose "Update" option and make note "Updating with *TKyear TKquarter* numbers", or something like that.

### Best practices
* Update the interactive and publish the flat as soon as possible after the company reports. Clients use these graphics!
* *Add more here!*
