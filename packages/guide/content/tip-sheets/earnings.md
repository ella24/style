- Company's investor relations page
- Link to the 'interactive' graphic
- Link to spreadsheets containing updatable data

### How to update when companies report new earnings
1. _Visit company's investor relations page_ and find the financial statement for the quarter you want to update. You can find this by either visiting the link in the `INVESTOR RELATIONS` column in the spreadsheet or googling something like `Tesla investor relations`
2. Determine what figures you need to update by refering to the datapoints in the already published graphic. These commonly include EPS (earnings per share), ROE (return on investment), revenue, net income and sales/users/deliveries. So for example, if the charts in the final graphic show EPS, revenue and net income, that's what you need to search for in the investor relations financial statement.
3. _Update the graphic with the latest figures._ Open the spreadsheet with the figures you need to update. You can find the spreadsheet in column `SHEET-1`. If there are two sheets feeding the graphic, the second will be in `SHEET 2`.
