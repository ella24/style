## Publishing checklist

#### ... for GRAPHICS EDITORS

_As soon as you are making headway on your project and a tentative publication date has been set..._

Make a NewsPlanner entry or add in the Graphics tab of existing text NewsPlanner entry (can keep it INTERNAL until closer to publication)

_Once a test link that is in good shape is available..._

- Circulate link to relevant editors/reporters
- Check with your news lead that there is a editor/desk editor lined up to review the project ahead of publication
- Give social and dotcom a heads up that your project is coming (if possible, good to alert them a few days ahead). You can use the social and dot com teams channel.
Start preparing static versions of your interactive projects if relevant

_Close to publication..._

- Make the final link
- Circulate final link to story editor so that it can be placed in accompanying text story (if applicable) and also to social and dotcom. (Do not say that this has been “published” when communicating as it might imply that the project is already out in the world and can be confusing to editors, just say this is the final link they can use)
- Make sure all statics are ready
- Update NewsPlanner entry if needed with final publishing date
- Prepare tweet threads and social assets if project warrants it
- Check embed version of interactive and make sure it works

_Publication day..._

- Publish on server: Media interactive and accompanying media static EPS files
- Text editor will also publish the story to the wire with the final URL and story is slugged GRAPHIC
- Let social and dotcom know that the project has been published (you can say it’s published now) by dropping a note into the social and dot com teams channel.
- Put slug and captions for interactive and statics in the Global Production > Graphics Teams channel
- Tweet from @reutersgraphics before tweeting from personal accounts (do not scoop Reuters)

#### ... for NEWS LEADS

_Pitch stage and early prep..._

- Pitch project to Global-pitches if relevant
- Add to Newsleads channel weekly update
- Alert Marketing/Ad sales
- Agree on tentative publishing date with all internal parties involved

_As soon as some headway has been made on the project..._

- Make a NewsPlanner entry or add in the Graphics tab of existing text NewsPlanner entry (can keep it INTERNAL until closer to publication)
- Consider other forms the project could be distributed and contact relevant editors:
  - Can this be made into packaged video?
  - Is this worth a tweet thread?
  - Can this be an Instagram story?
  - Would Reuters Events be interested? Perhaps a Reddit AMA?
  - Should we pitch to Apple News?
  - If there’s not already an accompanying story, should we also publish a short text piece with it? (Text editors should have the GRAPHIC tag in the headline (e.g. "GRAPHIC-Voting by mail in the U.S.") and the URL in the advisory field (e.g. Open XXXXX in an external browser to see the interactive graphic)

_Once a test link that is in good shape is available..._

- Circulate link to relevant editors/reporters
- Make sure there is a editor/desk editor lined up to review the project ahead of publication by speaking to your regional desk.
- Give social and dotcom a heads up that your project is coming (if possible, good to alert them a few days ahead)
- Have team prep statics if relevant and that embed version works

_Close to publication..._

- Make the final link
- Circulate final link to story editor so that it can be placed in accompanying text story (if applicable) and also to social and dotcom. (Do not say that this has been “published” when communicating as it might imply that the project is already out in the world and can be confusing to editors, just say this is the final link they can use)
- Update NewsPlanner entry if needed with final publishing date. If publishing date needs to be changed, make sure all internal parties are aware and agree to new date/time
  - Consider making entry public facing at this state unless exclusive
  - If it’s a big piece, add GLOBAL-NEWS-CALL, GLOBAL-FRONTPAGE calendar to entry.
- Make sure social assets are ready

_Publication day..._

- Let social and dotcom know that project has been published (you can say it’s published now)
- Make sure media interactive and all statics etc move to clients
- Tweet project
- Add link to graphics.reuters.com
