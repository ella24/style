### Code editor

You can use any text editor to work on graphics, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for three major features built in to VS Code:

- **Snippets** let us package code shortcuts with projects. [Read more.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)
- **Linters** can format your code automatically on save and are an easy way to learn good coding habits.
- **Live share** lets you work on code with others directly in your editor. [Read more.](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share)

VS Code is available for free download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Recommended Extensions

VS Code allows you to install extensions that add additional features to your editor. We recommend the following:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) with the following options:
  - Code Actions on Save: Mode = all
  - Format: Enable = true
  - Package Manager: yarn
- [sort-imports](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amatiasq.sort-imports) with the following options:
  - On-save = true
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- [EJS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support)
- [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
